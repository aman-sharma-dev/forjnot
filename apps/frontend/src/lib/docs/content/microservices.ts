      <p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        <strong>Microservices</strong> is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
      </p>

      <h2 class="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10" id="when-to-use-microservices">ðŸš¦ When Should You Use Microservices?</h2>
      <ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
        <li>Your application is growing and becoming difficult to manage as a single codebase (monolith).</li>
        <li>You want to scale specific parts of your system independently (e.g., scale only the API or worker service).</li>
        <li>Your team is large and you want to enable independent development and deployment cycles.</li>
        <li>You need to use different technologies or databases for different parts of your system.</li>
        <li>You want to improve system resilienceâ€”if one service fails, others keep running.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10" id="purpose-of-microservices">ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Microservices</h2>
      <ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
        <li>Break down complex applications into manageable, focused services.</li>
        <li>Enable independent deployment and scaling of services.</li>
        <li>Allow teams to work autonomously on different services.</li>
        <li>Increase system resilience and fault isolation.</li>
        <li>Facilitate technology diversity and experimentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10" id="types-of-microservices">ðŸ”— Types of Microservices</h2>
      <ul class="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
        <li><strong>API Services:</strong> Handle HTTP requests and expose endpoints for clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Worker Services:</strong> Perform background jobs, processing, or scheduled tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Gateway Services:</strong> Aggregate and route requests to other microservices.</li>
        <li><strong>Event-Driven Services:</strong> Communicate via events/messages (e.g., using queues or pub/sub).</li>
        <li><strong>Database Services:</strong> Own and manage specific data domains.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="leading-7">
        Forjnot is architected to make adding microservices seamless. You can introduce new services (like <code>apps/worker</code>, <code>apps/api-gateway</code>, etc.) right alongside your existing apps. The shared <code>packages/</code> directory lets you reuse types, DTOs, configs, and utilities across all services, making scaling and maintenance a breeze.

If youâ€™re building something unique and want to integrate a microservice beyond whatâ€™s included, feel free to reach out. While Forjnot is opinionated, itâ€™s also flexible â€” and Iâ€™m happy to help guide you through adding support for popular backends Iâ€™ve worked with (like Node.js/NestJS, Python/FastAPI/Flask).

Want to collaborate or need a tailored setup?
